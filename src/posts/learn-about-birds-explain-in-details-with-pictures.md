### 7﻿. *Average ages of birds*

The lifespan of birds varies greatly depending on species. Some small songbirds may only live for a few years, while larger birds of prey and parrots can live for several decades or even longer in some cases. Here are some general estimates of lifespan for different types of birds:

* ***. Small songbirds:*** Many small songbirds, such as sparrows, finches, and warblers, have relatively short lifespans, typically ranging from 2 to 5 years.
* ***. Waterfowl and game birds***: Ducks, geese, and other waterfowl species may live for 5 to 10 years or more, depending on the species and environmental factors.
* ***. Birds of prey***: Raptors like eagles, hawks, and owls tend to have longer lifespans compared to smaller birds. Many species can live for 10 to 30 years or more in the wild, with some large eagles and vultures living for several decades.
* ***. Parrots and cockatoos***: Parrots and cockatoos are known for their long lifespans in captivity, often living for several decades or even over 50 years with proper care.
* ***. Seabirds***: Seabirds such as albatrosses and petrels are among the longest-lived birds, with some species known to live for over 50 years or even up to 70 years.

It's important to note that these are general estimates, and individual lifespans can vary based on factors such as genetics, environmental conditions, predation, disease, and human impacts. Additionally, birds in captivity often have longer lifespans compared to their wild counterparts due to reduced predation risk, access to veterinary care, and consistent food sources.
